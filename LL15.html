      <dt>Mercury</dt>
      <dd>
        Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar
        System. It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due
        to overlapping impact events. These features are well preserved since
        the planet has no geological activity and an extremely tenuous
        atmosphere called an exosphere.

      <dt>Venus</dt>
      <dd>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the
        densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar System, and the
        only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital
        neighbour Earth.

      <dt>Earth</dt>
      <dd>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
        known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the
        only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all
        of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of
        Earth's crust.
